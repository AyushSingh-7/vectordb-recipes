Finetune Llama-2-7b using QLora on a Google colab
Explore instruction fine-tuning and how to address catastrophic forgetting in large language models (LLMs). Learn how to enhance precision tasks with instruction fine-tuning, even with smaller models and resource constraints.

Strategies Covered
Discover strategies like task-specific multitask fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to tackle catastrophic forgetting. Focus on PEFT's memory efficiency and its impact on LLMs.

Introducing LoRA and QLoRA
Learn about LoRA (Low-rank Adaptation) and QLoRA (Quantized Low-rank Adaptation), parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Understand their benefits and differences.

Hands-On Implementation
Get hands-on experience with QLoRA implementation using Transformers and Bits & Bytes libraries. Includes model selection, training, saving, and sharing on the Hugging Face Hub. Instructions for model loading and text generation tasks are provided.
