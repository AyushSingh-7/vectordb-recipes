# **Chunking Approaches for Multilingual Text Processing**  

## **Overview**  
This notebook explores various **text chunking strategies** and analyzes their effectiveness for **different languages**. It is based on insights from [this article](https://blog.lancedb.com/chunking-analysis-which-is-the-right-chunking-approach-for-your-language/).  

## **Key Topics**  
- **Fixed-length chunking** (e.g., character-based, token-based)  
- **Semantic chunking** (based on sentence structure, meaning)  
- **Language-specific considerations** (handling non-Latin scripts, different grammar structures)  
- **Impact on retrieval performance** (how chunking affects search & embeddings)  

## **Usage**  
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install lancedb transformers sentence-transformers nltk spacy
   ```
2. Run the notebook to compare **different chunking methods**.  
3. Analyze results to find the best approach for your language-specific dataset.  

## **Expected Outcome**  
- Understanding of how chunking affects **semantic search** and **retrieval quality**.  
- Guidelines on selecting **optimal chunk sizes** based on language and use case.
