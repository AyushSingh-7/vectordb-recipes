# FarmerGPT: RAG with PDF for Farmer Data

This project demonstrates how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using farmer-specific data. The data is extracted from a PDF containing crop variety information for sugarcane, turmeric, bamboo, cashew nuts, and more. The application leverages **LangChain** and **LanceDB** to create a customizable and extensible FarmerGPT solution.
