**AI Powered Job Search**
======================================================

An **AI-powered job search** application delivering unmatched speed, accuracy, and relevance in job recommendations. This platform uses **LanceDB** as vector database for efficient semantic search, **React.js** for a seamless user interface, **Node.js** for robust backend services, and **LangChain.js** for natural language understanding. It processes and retrieves job listings using advanced filtering mechanisms, ensuring precise and accurate results as per to user's filters.

**Getting Started**
-------------------

### **1\. Prerequisites**

-   **Node.js** version **20+**

-   A valid [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/signup)

### **2\. Installation**

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
npm install
```

### **3\. Configure API Key**

Add your OpenAI API key in `.env` or direclty export from you terminal for quick testing:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```


### **4\. Customizing the Dataset**
---------------------------

Replace or augment the job posting dataset for tailored results:

1.  Navigate to `src/Backend/dataSourceFiles`.

2.  Replace the existing `.csv` file with your custom dataset.

3.  Restart the backend server to apply the changes.

For example, utilize the **Jobs Dataset** from Kaggle: Jobs Dataset on Kaggle [Jobs posting dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravindrasinghrana/job-description-dataset)
